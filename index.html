    <h1>Why Working Together is Important</h1>

    
    <p>There are many divides in the world. 
        They seem to be getting bigger and bigger each day. 
        People are constantly fighting eachother on who's right and what to do.</p>
    
    
    <p>My UN goal was Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. 
        I believe that by showing people the benefit of working together, 
        we may come closer to achieving that goal.</p>
    
   
    <p>The game above may show you how working together can help both sides of a party. 
        It is based off of the story of the Tortoise and the Hare which you can view 
        <a class="intextlink" href="https://read.gov/aesop/025.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
        The twist in this game is that the tortoise and the hare have to work together to progress in the game.
